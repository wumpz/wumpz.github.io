## How to find Netbeans Platform special pathes

This is a small hint of mine. For those special pathes Netbeans comes with the class `Places`. Here you get the user dir, the cache dir and more.

* org.netbeans.modules: Pathes: user dir, ...
   Places. ...

This artifact has to be installed.

```xml

```
