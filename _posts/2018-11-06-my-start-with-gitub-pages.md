# A journey begins

Now that I decided to need some space to collect my findings and thoughts I started digging around, to find a solution for my problem. I knew about **github-pages**, but never had the ambitions to learn more about it. That has changed.

## First try: using  simple github pages template

I started a simple site using the [cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) theme. This seems to be ok for very simple sites, but why should I start there. Outthere is sincerly somebody that took all hurdles for me :).
